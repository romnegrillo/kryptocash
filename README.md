# Kryptocash

Welcome to my first full-stack dApp, a project that represents my initial dive into the world of Solidity and its integration with React. This application is a humble yet significant step into my Web 3 journey! It enables users to connect to their MetaMask wallet, send funds accompanied by personalized messages and GIFs, and monitor all transactions made through the app. The smart contract has been deployed on the Ethereum Testnet to avoid gas fees, but it's fully functional and compatible with the Mainnet as well!
